        KSA recently announced the establishment of new Special Integrated
        Logistics Zones (“ILBZ”) aimed at attracting foreign investment and
        increasing the perception of KSA as a regional hub. As per the
        regulations setting out the rules for ILBZ, entities established and
        carrying out approved activities inside ILBZ will be exempt from KSA
        corporate income tax for fifty years. In addition to the income tax
        exemption, the initiative will not consider non-residents conducting
        economic activities inside the Zone as Permanent Establishments. Also,
        goods located inside ILBZ will be free of custom duties and VAT (GACA).
